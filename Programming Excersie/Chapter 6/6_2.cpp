/*
6.2: Define a class String that could work as a user-defined string type. Include 
constructors that will enable us to create an uninitialized string:
    String s1; // string with length 0
    And also initialize an object with a string constant at the time of creation like
    String s2(“Well done!”);
    Include a function that adds two strings to make a third string. Note that the statement
    S2 = s1;
    will be perfectly reasonable expression to copy one string to another.
Write a complete program to test your class to see that it does the following tasks:
    (a) Creates uninitialized string objects.
    (b) Creates objects with string constants.
    (c) Concatenates two strings properly.
    (d) Displays a desired string object
