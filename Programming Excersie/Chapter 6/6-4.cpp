/*
6.4: Improve the system design in Exercise 6.3 to incorporate the following features:
    (a) The price of the books should be updated as and when required. 
    Use a private member function to implement this.
    (b) The stock value of each book should be automatically updated as soon as 
    a transaction is completed.
    (c) The number of successful and unsuccessful transactions should be recorded for the
    purpose of statistical analysis. Use static data members to keep count of transactions.
