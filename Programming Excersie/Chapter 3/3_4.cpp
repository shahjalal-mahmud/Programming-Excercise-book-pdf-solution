3.4 Write a program to evaluate the following investment equation
        V = P(1+r)^n
and print the tables which would give the value of V 
for various combination of the following values of P, r and n:
        P: 1000, 2000, 3000,..., 10,000
        r: 0.10, 0.11, 0.12,...., 0.20
        n: 1, 2, 3,.....10

(Hint: P is the principal amount and V is the value of money at the end of n years. 
This equation can be recursively written as
        V = P(1+r)
        P=V
In other words, the value of money at the end of the first year becomes 
the principal amount for the next year, and so on.
